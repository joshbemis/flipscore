"""
version 0.1 
created 2025-08-13
intention is to create a simple program to keep score for Flip 7
Scores for Flip 7 are running totals
default winning condition is a score of 200
each player that ends the round with cards adds the total of their cards
if a player has 7 value cards in the line, they get a bonus 15 points
set up two modes: basic and guided
basic will take simple inputs from the user and add those inputs to the user's score
guided will allow the user to input the values of each individual card, add those to get the score, then add the score to the total
build basic first

maybe allow two differnet table displays: by round and just total by player
