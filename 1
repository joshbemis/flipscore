# version 0.1 
# created 2025-08-13
# intention is to create a simple program to keep score for Flip 7
# Scores for Flip 7 are running totals
# default winning condition is a score of 200
# each player that ends the round with cards adds the total of their cards
# if a player has 7 value cards in the line, they get a bonus 15 points
# set up two modes: basic and guided
# basic will take simple inputs from the user and add those inputs to the user's score
# guided will allow the user to input the values of each individual card, add those to get the score, then add the score to the total
# build basic first

# use class for users

from tabulate import tabulate

# use tabulate to print scores.
# define table as a list
# each item in that list is another list that contains the values by row
# ex:
# table = [["Round 1", 5, 10], ["Round 2", 10, 15]]
# print(tabulate(table))

# first set up user input for score
score = input("Josh's round 1 score: ")

score_table = [["Round 1", score]]
print(tabulate(score_table))
